I really hope that they will add more updated arcade games such as Taiko and Wangan. I'm sure it will bring fortune to the arcade and Im sorry to give only 3 star.;First i would like to complain about all the gaole pokemon machine is all broken none of them is working, and my purpose to come is to play the gaole machine, and i don't know is broken so i scanned it and guess what no refund for me, so i \u2026;Lots of game options to play, great package deals, friendly and helpful workers. Overall best molly fantasy yet;Hopes the arcade machine is variety.\nThis is the place for children and adults to release tension.",
