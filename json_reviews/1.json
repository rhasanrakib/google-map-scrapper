Even tho this restaurant is tucked away in a corner of the basement of Main place, I enjoyed my dijing experience there.  Firstly, the food... I enjoyed the butter chicken rice. It was very flavourful especially when \u2026;Their personal meal - roasted chicken rice set was pretty well priced, lots of meat and also seasoned butter rice.\nThe curry chicken, however, can be improved. Basically it\u2019s not chicken cooked \u2026;Food is good as many reviews before.\nThe soup that comes with chicken rice, brings back the taste of chicken rice of the olden days \u2764\ufe0f \u2026;Halal place.\n\nrm20 for mix roast chicken and bbq chicken. I really liked the chicken rice dark soy sauce that they have at the table. Yum! Their chili sauce and ginger was just so so.;A small cosy restaurant at Main Place mall to hang out with small group of friends if you manage to grab the sofa seats. \u2026;Loved the dry wantan noodles with bbq chicken. The noodles were springy and the chicken was tender and juicy. The bean sprouts were faily crunchy and fleshy too. \u2026;1st time to here. Cozy enviroment with comfort foods. Excellent foods. The sour spicy vegetable was simple mouth watering. The President Kaya Butter Toast was perfectly perfect with huge slice of butter in between the Kaya! Love it! Will definitely come back again !",
